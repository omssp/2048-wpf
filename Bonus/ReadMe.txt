Hi!

Small bonus for testing purpose/fun. Find 3 files inside (saves):
save_file_before_gameover.xml -- few moves and game is over, suitable for demonstration GameOverWindow functionality.
save_file_you_win.xml -- one move and you win, suitable for demonstration YouWinWindow functionality.
save_file_fullhouse.xml -- just for fun, extremely high tile could be reached quite easy.

Application works with file save_file.xml, which is available in %LOCALAPPDATA%/2048 folder.
Folder would be created automatically, just start the game. Alternatively you can create it manually.
File save_file.xml could be replaced by one of the files above (name should be save_file.xml any way).

Have fun!
Daniil
